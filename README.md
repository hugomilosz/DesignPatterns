# DesignPatterns

## Singleton Pattern:

A design pattern which ensures that a class only has one instance.

This pattern defies the Single Responsibility Principle as it solves two issues simulataneously: it ensures a class has only one instance and it provides a global access point to thaat instance.

## Template Method:

A behavioural design pattern which defines a skeleton of an algorithm in an abstract class, consisting of a few basic steps, and classes implement and override these steps, known as hooks, but they cannot change the skeleton.

New subclasses can be implemented to create a new version of the algorithm with ease, but the skeleton defined in the abstract class is fixed and must be stuck to.
